Jason and I are planning to Model the transmission of a zombie apocalypse utilizing the SIR model for the spread of infectious diseases.

By utilizing  the SIR(susceptible, infectious, recovered) model for the spread of infectious diseases, Jason and I  will depict the patterns seen during a zombie apocalypse. This model allows us to use our independent variable, time, to depict the relationship between those who are susceptible to getting infected, those who are infected, and those who are recovering.

This applies to physics by analyzing the number of organisms infected by the disease within a certain period of time. Knowing how to depict the spread of a disease is crucial to today’s society. Due to our high population, the probabilities of someone getting an infectious disease is high as opposed to 2 centuries ago. 
 
In order to make a proper graph, we plan to use a modified version of the 4th order Runge-Kutta ODE solver that we created in weekly session 9. We plan to make our program interactive by asking the user certain questions. We hope to take into consideration population density, rate at which the zombies travel, and if people are isolating themselves. 

The Runge-Kutta method is the best method to use for our project because it estimates solutions for ordinary differential equations via multiple iterations, fast and accurate, as opposed to using Euler’s method. What Runge-Kutta does is help us differntiate our ODE that we have set up, Thus allowing us to successfully depict graphs describing the population if susceptable, Infectected, zombies, and dead individuals.


The equations that we will be using are:
S'(t) = h-\beta SZ -delta(s)S
  This formula takes into account those who are susceptible to get infected with the zombie virus.
I'(t) =\beta SZ- \phi I - delta(I)I 
  This formula takes into account those are infected.
Z'(t) =delta(I) - \alpha SZ 
   This formula takes into account those are NOW zombies.
D'(t) =delta(s)S + delta(I)I + \alpha SZ
  This formula takes into account those who are dead.
  
Where:
‘h’ is the number of humans we started with that are susceptible to the disease.
\beta is the transition rate.
S is those who are susceptible
Z is those who are zombies
delta(s) is the rate at which susceptible people have died.
\phi rate at which people turn into zombies
delta(I)rate at which infected people have died.
I is the number of infected individuals
\alpha rate of killing.

I am interested  in this topic because of the current events going on with COVID-19. During this time there are many graphs depicting the spread of the Novel Coronavirus under different circumstances. I am excited to learn how one codes different conditional statements such as what if the community keeps themselves in quarantine? What if the community avoids staying in quarantine? Does the speed in which the zombies travel affect the rate in which the disease spreads? How does the population size affect the rate in which the disease spreads (ie. x number of people cause y-percent of increase in the rate of the spread)?

I will be working with Jason on this project. Jason will focus on population density and how it affects the rate in which the disease spreads. I will be focusing on the effects of isolation to the rate in which the disease travels. Of course we will be helping each other, but this is a good start to constructing a great program.
