  Be able to model algebraicly the rate in which a disease spreads.<br /> 
  Be able to then add more detail to this model (sitll algebraicly) <br /> 
    - speed in which individuals travel<br /> 
    - quarentine<br /> 
    - population density<br /> 
  We are in hopes to finish the general model by Monday.<br /> <br />
