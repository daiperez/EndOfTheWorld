# EndOfTheWorld

This code will model the  transmission of a zombie apocalypse utilizing the SIR model for the spread of infectious diseases.
It will use a modified version of the 4th order Runge-Kutta ODE solver that was created in weekly session 9 for computational physics. The fourth order Runge-Kutta method is the best method to use for our project because it estimates solutions for ordinary differential equations via multiple iterations, fast and accurate, as opposed to using Eulerâ€™s method.
This code takes into consideration many scenarios, including faster zombies, quarantined infected, and fighting back against the zombie apocalypse.
