# EndOfTheWorld

This code will model the  transmission of a zombie apocalypse utilizing the SIR model for the spread of infectious diseases.
It will use a modified version of the 4th order Runge-Kutta ODE solver that we created in weekly session 9 for computational physics. The Runge-Kutta method is the best method to use for our project because it estimates solutions for ordinary differential equations via multiple iterations, fast and accurate, as opposed to using Eulerâ€™s method.
This program is designed to be interactive by asking the user certain questions. 
This code takes into consideration population density, rate at which the zombies travel, and if people are isolating themselves.
