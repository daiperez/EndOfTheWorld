    "The spread of infectious diseases can be modelled using sets of ordinary differential equations, or ODEs. The ODE functions come from the SIR model for infectious disease, and have been modified slightly to account for the combined number of dead humans and zombies. The ODEs utilize parameters such as the infection rate, zombie death rate, initial population sizes, etc, to calculate the spread of the infection. We are also working on a way to implement more parameters such as speed of zombie and transmission rate that can be conditionally called. These will be modifiers on variables of change, for example dS would be modified by a transmission rate constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ODE solver was used to solve these differential equations, generating graphs to display how the human race did given a specific set of parameters. The boundary for this set of functions is either zombies or humans wipe the other out. "
